# 🎮 Word Guessing Game

A Python mini hangman-style game where you guess letters or the whole word. Includes scoring, best record tracking, and special rules to prevent “lucky guesses.”

## Features

- Guess letters or the entire word
- Secret words randomly chosen from a predefined list
- Records your best attempt (minimum guesses)
- Special rules: prevent revealing all blanks by one lucky guess
- Interactive terminal gameplay with clear display

## How to Play

1. Run `python game.py` in your terminal.
2. The secret word will be displayed as underscores (`_ _ _ _ _ _`).
3. Guess one letter at a time or try to guess the whole word.
4. If a guess fills all blanks but isn’t correct, the game will hide the result with `#`.
5. The game tracks your best record (least number of guesses).
